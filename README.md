Counter App with Theme Switch and Popup

This Angular-based application features a simple counter with increment/decrement functionality, theme switching (light/dark mode), and a welcome popup message. The app is responsive and accessible, with a clean UI that includes an options bar for refreshing the counter, toggling themes, and viewing additional information about the app. Built with Angular Material icons and a service for state management, it's a lightweight and user-friendly project designed for basic interactive functionality.
